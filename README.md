# Dinucleotide-patterns
Dinucleotide pattern in various genomic regions of Homo sapiens and in exonic region of eukaryotes
Dinucleotide is two adjacent nucleotides in a DNA separated by a single phosphate group. From the four nitrogen bases, (4*4) 16 dinucleotides can be derived, which are ApA,  ApT, ApG, ApC, TpA, TpT, TpG, TpC, GpA, GpT, GpG, GpC, CpA, CpT, CpG and CpC. There is a distinct signature of dinucleotide and its difference among different species (Gentles, A. J. (2001). This may be due to DNA replication and repair mechanisms and biases in DNA modification processes like base-step stacking energies and DNA conformational tendencies, context dependent mutation, and DNA methylation patterns (Karlin 1998).
